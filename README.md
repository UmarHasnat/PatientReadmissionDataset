# Patient Readmission Dataset 🩺

Patient Readmission project consists of Dataset and it's Solution designed to help healthcare providers identify patients at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge. The system uses machine learning to generate a personalized risk score based on patient information.

## 🔍 Project Overview

## 🎯 Goal: Reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions through early prediction.

💡 Solution: Use ML models trained on patient data to calculate a risk score and provide follow-up recommendations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Machine Learning: Used Multiple ML Libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sklearn.

Version Control: GitHub

## 🧠 How It Works
Just copy the Notebook file and CSV file and run it in your local machine.

## 📊 Model Performance
Training Accuracy: 96%

Validation Accuracy: 97%

Test Accuracy: 93%
Model used: Support Vector Machine (SVM) This was the final model that outperformed everyother model.


## 🔐 Disclaimer
This is a prototype version of the system. No real patient data is used. The system is not yet integrated with real hospital EHRs
